# Hamming Distance

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return  *the  **Hamming distance**  between them*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1

 

 **Note:**  This question is the same as 2220: Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number.

        int n = x ^ y;
        int count = 0;

        while (n != 0) {
            count += n & 1;
            n = n >> 1;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
